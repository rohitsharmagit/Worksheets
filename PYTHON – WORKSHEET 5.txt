Q11 is subjective answer type question, answer it briefly.
11. List any two major differences between lists and sets in python.
Answer:
Two major differences between lists and sets in pythonn are:

List:
the order of elements is well defined,
duplicates are possible.

Set:
the order of the elements is unknown,
elements are unique.


Q12 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

12. write a python program to square the elements of a list by using list comprehension.
Answer:
# Python program to calculate square of numbers in list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared_numbers = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]

print("Squared numbers from list: ",squared_numbers)


13. Write a python program to drop duplicate elements from a list of numbers.
Answer:
# Python code to remove duplicate elements 
def Remove(duplicate): 
    final_list = [] 
    for num in duplicate: 
        if num not in final_list: 
            final_list.append(num) 
    return final_list 
      
 
duplicate = [2, 4, 10, 20, 5, 2, 20, 4] 

print("Removed Duplicate items: ",Remove(duplicate)) 

14. Take two sets of numbers and try implementing the set operations - intersection, union, difference and symmetric_difference between them.
Answer:
# Program to perform different set operations 
# as we do in  mathematics 

#| for union.
#& for intersection.
#– for difference
#^ for symmetric difference

  
# sets are define 
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}; 
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
  
# union 
print("Union :", A | B) 
  
# intersection 
print("Intersection :", A & B) 
  
# difference 
print("Difference :", A - B) 
  
# symmetric difference 
print("Symmetric difference :", A ^ B) 

15. Write a python program to add the elements of a set.
Answer:
# Adding elements of set
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
print("Sum of elements in a given set:", sum(set1))
