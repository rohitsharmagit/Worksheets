Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Answer:
List:
The list is a datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square brackets which are mutable .i.e it can be converted into another datatype and can store any data element in it.

Tuple:
Tuple is a collection of values stored in a tuple can be of any type separated by ‚Äòcommas‚Äô by closing the sequence of values in parentheses. 
Tuple is a immutable sequence in python which cannot be changed or replaced since it is immutable.

Set:
Sets are unoreder collection of elements or unintended collection of items In python.It is defined under curly braces{}.Sets are immutable.i.e it cannot be changed or replaced.

Dictionary:
Dictionary is a built-in Python Data Structure that is mutable. It is similar in spirit to List, Set, and Tuples.
However, it is not indexed by a sequence of numbers but indexed based on keys and can be understood as associative arrays.It consists of a key with an associated value.


12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô with space in python.
Answer: 
In python, the string data types are immutable. Which means a string value cannot be updated.
Below is the small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô with space in python.
#String defined
string="I+Love+Python"

print("Original string: ",string)

# replacing + with space
print("Replaced String: ",string.replace("+"," "))


13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.
Answer: 
ord() function is an in-built function in python which takes string represents of a single character, return an integer representing the unicode code point of that character.
For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97.

# Function to get datatype check
def typeCheck(x):
    print("Variable datatype is : ",type(x))

# variable declaration
var=8

#Function call
typeCheck(var)
