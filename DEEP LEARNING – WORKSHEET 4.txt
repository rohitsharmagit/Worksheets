Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type question. Answer them briefly.
11. Describe the basic architecture of a CNN?
Answer:
CNN architecture is inspired by the organization and functionality of the visual cortex and designed to mimic the connectivity pattern of neurons within the human brain.

The neurons within a CNN are split into a three-dimensional structure, with each set of neurons analyzing a small region or feature of the image. In other words, each group of neurons specializes in identifying one part of the image. CNNs use the predictions from the layers to produce a final output that presents a vector of probability scores to represent the likelihood that a specific feature belongs to a certain class.

How a Convolutional Neural Network Works━The CNN layers
A CNN is composed of several kinds of layers:

Convolutional layer-creates a feature map to predict the class probabilities for each feature by applying a filter that scans the whole image, few pixels at a time.
Pooling layer (downsampling)-scales down the amount of information the convolutional layer generated for each feature and maintains the most essential information (the process of the convolutional and pooling layers usually repeats several times).
Fully connected input layer—“flattens” the outputs generated by previous layers to turn them into a single vector that can be used as an input for the next layer.
Fully connected layer—applies weights over the input generated by the feature analysis to predict an accurate label.
Fully connected output layer-generates the final probabilities to determine a class for the image.


12. What is convolution in CNN? What is the role of convolution in image processing?
Answer:
The term convolution refers to the mathematical combination of two functions to produce a third function. It merges two sets of information. 
In the case of a CNN, the convolution is performed on the input data with the use of a filter or kernel (these terms are used interchangeably) to then produce a feature map.
Convolution is a simple mathematical operation which is fundamental to many common image processing operators. Convolution provides a way of `multiplying together' 
two arrays of numbers, generally of different sizes, but of the same dimensionality, to produce a third array of numbers of the same dimensionality.


13. What is the difference between Max Pooling and Average Pooling? Explain briefly.
Answer:
Average pooling method smooths out the image and hence the sharp features may not be identified when this pooling method is used. 
Max pooling selects the brighter pixels from the image. 
It is useful when the background of the image is dark and we are interested in only the lighter pixels of the image.

14. What is Padding? Why is it used?
Answer:
The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

15. Describe the layers used in classification part of a CNN?
Answer:
There are three types of layers in a convolutional neural network: convolutional layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer. 
Each of these layers has different parameters that can be optimized and performs a different task on the input data.

Convolutional layers are the layers where filters are applied to the original image, or to other feature maps in a deep CNN. 
This is where most of the user-specified parameters are in the network. The most important parameters are the number of kernels and the size of the kernels.

Pooling layers are similar to convolutional layers, but they perform a specific function such as max pooling, which takes the maximum value in a certain filter region,
or average pooling, which takes the average value in a filter region. These are typically used to reduce the dimensionality of the network.

Fully connected layers are placed before the classification output of a CNN and are used to flatten the results before classification. This is similar to the output layer of an MLP.
